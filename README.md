I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by testing it thoroughly and frequently. I can also run JUnit tests to make sure the program is working as designed per the functional requirements. I would also recommend running a Dependency-Check, such as Maven to ensure that no components or plugins of the code are outdated or are at risk of any potential security vulnerabilities.

I interpret use needs and incorporate them into a program based on each needâ€™s criticality and practicality. I determine if the needs are functional needs or non-functional needs, and whether or not these requires adhere or deviate from their business requirements. Once I've made my assessments and evaluations, I then create a functional diagram to map out the blueprint of the program before I begin to code. After approval has been received for the functional diagram, I then begin the coding process and continue to develop and test using a continuous iterative approach. 

I approach designing software by taking an overall methodical testing approach to each object and its corresponding service. I found that the more meticulous and consistent I was with developing the code for each object and service directly correlated to the accuracy of the testing results.
